# Directives

It can be seen as an HTML element or attriibute that is used to enhance and extend our HTML

There are three different types of directive in Angular:
- Component `<bs-app></bs-app>`: they have a template
- Structural `NgIf, NgFor, NgClass`: change the DOM layout
- Attribute `<p highlight></p>`: change the appearance or behaviour of an element (custom directive)
