# Routing

- We need to add `<base href="/">` in the `index.html`. 
  This represents that we wnat the root of our application at the index.

- We import the `RouterModule` in the `app.module.ts` and into the `NgModule` `imports`
`import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';`

- We need to add `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` in app the component
